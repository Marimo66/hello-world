# hello-world

- Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
I am trying to review/refresh as well as hone my programming skills to prepare myself for the university computer science program. Also, it sounds more impressive that I am taking a computer science course and end up using it for my top 6. I also get a period each day to make cool stuff with code that would otherwise take a lot of my free time. 

- What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.
I really like Spotify for its ease of use. It is able to play literally every type of song in existence, and songs that aren't avaliable, can be uploaded by yourself to listen to. On top of that, there is a sleep timer, looping tracks and shuffling, as well as options to download songs to play offline. I think it would be interesting to make a game in pygame but also include my own music player that can loop, shuffle, and play songs for a certain amount of time before shutting off. Plus, it would make debugging a game much funner since now I can vibe while suffering LOL
I also think the pomodoro timer is a cool application, where it plays background ambience noises for a certain amount of time before reminding you to take a short break before continuing.
